<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project started out life as a clone of <a href="https://github.com/jglovier/gifs">Joel Glovier's Excellent gif Storage project</a>.</p>

<p>After playing with it a bit I decided that I wanted to showcase not just animated gif's but other images and memes so I took his original gif collection and started shifting bits.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Feel free to open a pull request if you have a gif/image/meme that you really think belongs in here. However, I will generally only accept images that I think I will personally want to use.</p>
