#### Overview
<small>
This project started out life as a clone of <a href="https://github.com/jglovier/gifs">Joel Glovier's Excellent gif Storage project</a>.

After playing with it a bit I decided that I wanted to showcase not just animated gif's but other images and memes so I took his original gif collection and started shifting bits.
