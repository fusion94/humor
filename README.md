## Overview
This project started out life as a clone of [Joel Glovier's Excellent gif Storage project](https://github.com/jglovier/gifs).

After playing with it a bit I decided that I wanted to showcase not just animated gif's but other images and memes so I took his original gif collection and started shifting bits.

## Contributing
Feel free to open a pull request if you have a gif/image/meme that you really think belongs in here. However, I will generally only accept images that I think I will personally want to use.
